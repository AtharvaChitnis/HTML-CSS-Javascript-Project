                    JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language and core technology of the World Wide
                    Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2023, 98.7% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for
                    webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries.

                    Java is an OOP programming language while Java Script is an OOP scripting language. Java creates
                    applications that run in a virtual machine or browser while JavaScript code is run on a browser
                    only. Java code needs to be compiled while JavaScript code are all in text. They require different
                    plug-ins.

                    You can start learning JavaScript without prior knowledge of Java, and then decide if you want to
                    explore Java or other programming languages based on your interests and goals.

                    I’ve tried googling “the difference between JavaScript and ECMAScript.”

                    I ended up having to wade through a sea of ambiguous and seemingly conflicting results:

                    “ECMAScript is a standard.”

                    “JavaScript is a standard.”

                    “ECMAScript is a specification.”

                    “JavaScript is an implementation of the ECMAScript standard.”

                    “ECMAScript is standardized JavaScript.”

                    “ECMAScript is a language.”

                    “JavaScript is a dialect of ECMAScript.”

                    “ECMAScript is JavaScript.”

                    Holding back the urge to cry, I bucked up and decided to commit to some painful yet productive
                    research.

                    This article represents my current understanding of the differences between JavaScript and
                    ECMAScript. It is geared towards people who are familiar with JavaScript but would like a clearer
                    understanding of its relationship with ECMAScript, web browsers, Babel, and more. You will also
                    learn about scripting languages, JavaScript engines, and JavaScript runtimes for good measure.

                    So get pumped.
