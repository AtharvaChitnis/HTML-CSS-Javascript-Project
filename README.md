# Mastering HTML, CSS, and JavaScript w/ 100 Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository where I am showcasing 100 projects I've completed to master the fundamentals of web development using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. Each project is a stepping stone in my learning journey, designed to cover a wide range of concepts and techniques.

## Repository Highlights

### HTML Projects
- **Semantic Elements**: Using HTML5 tags to create meaningful and accessible web structures.
- **Forms and Tables**: Building interactive forms and well-organized tables for data representation.
- **Accessibility Practices**: Ensuring web content is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.

### CSS Projects
- **Flexbox and Grid**: Implementing modern layout techniques for flexible and responsive designs.
- **Animations**: Adding dynamic visual effects to enhance user experience.
- **Responsive Design**: Creating designs that work seamlessly across different devices and screen sizes.

### JavaScript Projects
- **DOM Manipulation**: Interactively modifying web pages in real-time.
- **Event Handling**: Creating interactive features like buttons, forms, and navigation menus.
- **API Integration**: Fetching and displaying data from external sources, adding dynamic content to web pages.

## Project Structure

Each project is contained within its own directory and includes:
- An `index.html` file
- A `style.css` file
- A `script.js` file (if applicable)

### Example Directory Structure:
```
/Project-01
  |-- index.html
